🧠 Image Classification using Deep Learning

Tech Stack: Python • TensorFlow • Keras • CNNs

This project explores deep learning–based image classification through two supervised learning tasks: binary classification (Cats vs Dogs) and multi-class digit recognition (0–9). The focus is on improving generalization through regularization, data augmentation, and hyperparameter optimization.

🔹 Cats vs Dogs Classifier (Binary Classification)

Built a convolutional neural network using Sigmoid activation for binary classification on 25K+ images.

Applied data augmentation and dropout, boosting generalization and improving validation accuracy by ~12%.

Achieved 73% accuracy in distinguishing between cat and dog images.

🔹 Handwritten Digit Recognition (0–9)

Developed a multi-class classifier using Softmax activation and batch normalization on the 60K+ sample MNIST dataset.

Performed hyperparameter tuning (learning rate, filters, batch size, optimizer) for scalable, stable performance.

Achieved 89% model accuracy on digit recognition.

🚀 Key Highlights

End-to-end deep learning workflow: preprocessing → model design → training → evaluation.

Focus on generalization using modern regularization techniques.

Modular, easy-to-extend codebase for experimenting with different architectures.
